## About Me

I am a wood construction engineer. This direction will not be in great demand in the near future due to the high cost of wood. Therefore, I decided to change my field of activity and try to master the profession of a Front end developer. This activity makes it possible to work remotely, as well as this profession gives unlimited opportunities for professional growth.
